description: |
  Offline installer for SH2 Enhanced Edition. Useful if you have already installed the game previously using the SH2EE online installer and want to quickly install it again (e.g. on another machine).
notes: | 
  Requires a zip archive of the game created with the SHE22 online installer. If you haven't installed the game before, run the online version of the script first, then create the zip for future use.
  
  Files in the zip must be in the top level of the archive (i.e sh2pc.exe should be in the zip root)

  No settings are changed as it's assumed everything was set up already during the online install.
