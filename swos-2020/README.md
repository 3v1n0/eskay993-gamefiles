Install script and guide for installing [SWOS 2020](https://www.sensiblesoccer.de/) by the SWOS United team on Steam Deck. Should work on any Linux desktop (just ignore or adapt any Steam Deck specifics instructions).

## **Pre-requisites**

Make sure you download these before starting the install process. More info is on the [SWOS United](https://www.sensiblesoccer.de/swos-2020) website.
- SWOS 2020 Windows installer from the4 [SWOS United - DOWNLOAD](https://www.sensiblesoccer.de/swos-2020) page.
  
- Original copy of SWOS 96/97 as detailed on the [SWOS United - DOWNLOAD](https://www.sensiblesoccer.de/swos-2020) page. The site has 3 links to choose from and they all work with this script (I personally use the GOG version and downloaded the setup exe from my GOG library)

## **Install Guide**
1. Switch to Desktop Mode on Steam Deck.

2. Make sure you have both files listed above on your Steam Deck. In your Downloads folder or Desktop should be fine.

3. Download the [install script](https://github.com/eskay993/gamefiles/raw/main/swos-2020/swos-2020-install-script..zip) from this repo and extract it. You should have a `.yaml` file. 

4. Install `Lutris` from the Discover Store.

5. Run `Lutris` and click the + sign to add a game.
   
6. Select `Install from local install script` and point to the yaml file you downloaded, then click `Install` and `Install` again on the next screen.

7. Chose where to install the game. The default is fine unless you want to change it. Also click `Create steam shortcut` so the game will be available in your library in Game Mode. Click Continue.
   
8. Click `Browse` under `SWOS 2020 setup exe` and select the SWOS Windows installer you downloaded earlier.

9. Click `Browse` under `Original SWOS 96/97` and select whatever version of SWOS 96/97 you downloaded earlier. Either the zip, or the exe if you downloaded the GOG version.

10. Click `Install` and let it do it's thing. At one point, it will autodetect SWOS 96/97 and you'll get a confirmation prompt. Click `OK` to continue.

11. Done!

You can test it's working in Desktop Mode by double clicking the game in Lutris, or just straight into Game Mode and launch it there. In Game Mode you can use the touch screen to navigate the launcher.

A few things to do post install after launching the game:
- In the launcher, choose `1280x720` as your resolution.

- Set you Steam Deck screen refresh rate to match whatever `Game Style` mode you choose in the launcher. For example, If you choose `Amiga 50 FPS`, set you screen refresh rate to 50Hz in the Steam Deck overlay.

- Also in the launcher, click the `Team DB` tab and update to the latest rosters. I had to do this manually even though auto-update was enabled.

- Once in the game, go to `Options` > `Controller` and choose `Xbox 360` as your controller.
