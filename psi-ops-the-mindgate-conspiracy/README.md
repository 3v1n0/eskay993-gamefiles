Installs the freeware Windows version of the [Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy](https://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/psi_ops_the_mindgate_conspiracy.html) from MajorGeek.com. Also installs the widescreen patch.


Notes:
- You will need to download the game zip yourself from MajorGeeks.com. No need to extract it. 
- The widescreen fix causes FMV cutscenes to align to the left of the screen. They play as normal otherwise.
- The game does not have native controller support. You can download my Community Layout on Steam.
