## Pre-Configured Settings for SPFL23

Some people are having trouble launching `Settings.exe` on Linux and are unable to change the game resolution
and set the game to fullscreen. These settings files have been pre-configured with various reoslutions 
and have fullscreen enabled.

### To install:
- Download [settings.zip](https://github.com/eskay993/gamefiles/raw/main/sp-football-life-2023/files/settings.zip) and extract it

- Copy `settings.dat` from the desired resolution folder to:
```
<GAME_INSTALL_PATH>/drive_c/users/<USER>>/Documents/KONAMI/eFootball PES 2021 SEASON UPDATE/
```

### Steam Deck Users:
Use the `settings.dat` from the `800x1280` folder.
