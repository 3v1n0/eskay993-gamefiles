## Pre-Configured Settings for SPFL23

Some people are having trouble launching "Settings.exe" on Linux and are unable to change the game resolution
and set the game to fullscreen. These settings files have been pre-configured with various reoslutions 
and have fullscreen enabled.

### To install:

Just copy `settings.dat` from the desired resolution folder to:
```
<GAME_INSTALL_PATH>/drive_c/users/<USER>>/Documents/KONAMI/eFootball PES 2021 SEASON UPDATE/
```

### Stead Deck Users:
Use the `settings.dat` from the `1280x800` folder.
