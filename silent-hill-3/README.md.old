# Intro
Updated Lutris installer scripts for the PC-DVD version of Silent Hill 3 based on chrll's original script. The game runs at a near solid 60FPS (even on Steam Deck), and everything should be configured out of the box, including widescreen and controller support.

The following fixes and patches are installed:
- No-DVD patch
- Widescreen Fix by ThirteenAG
- Xinput-Plus controller fix (e.g. for Xbox controllers)
- Audio fixes that correct the pitch of sfx/music (See Version Differences)
- Controller mapping applied to match PS2 control scheme
- Various settings tweaks applied for improved performance

# Version Differences
There are 2 version of the script, the main difference being which sound fix is installed.<br>

### **silent-hill-3-recommended-install-script.yaml**<br>
- Recommended version, particularly for Steam Deck. This is the one I use.
- Installs Silent Hill 3 PC Sound Fix, which directly modified the sound files to correct the pitch.
- Advantages:
    - In addition to the game setup files extracted from DVD/ISO, you only need to supply the No-DVD patch yourself. Everything else is downloaded and configured automatically. 
    - Cleaner and simpler install script with fewer steps.
    - Performance is a bit better on Steam Deck. More consistent 60FPS (and possibly better battery? Needs testing as I am just speculating!).
- Disadvantages:
    - This version of the sound fix only corrects the pitch to match PS2 audio. It does not alter audio compression. Still sounds great to me, and the trade off is worth it in my opinion.  


### **silent-hill-3-alternate-install-script.yaml**<br>
- Installs the newer [Audio Enhanced Pack v2.0.5](https://www.moddb.com/mods/silent-hill-3-audio-enhancement-pack/downloads/silent-hill-3-audio-enhancement-pack-version-205). This version fixes the pitch and uses uncompressed audio files for better sounds quality.
- Relaoded-II Mod Loader is also installed to automatically load the audio pack.

- Advantages:
    - Better audio quality, although not that noticeable on Steam Deck speakers.
    - In theory, having Reloaded-II means you can add other mods as well, but have not testing this.
- Disadvantages:
    - More complicated installs process that (very) occasionally fails and needs to be restarted.
    - Requires you to supply the DVD/ISO files, the No-DVD patch AND the Audio Enhancement Pack from Mod DB.
    - Requires more files to be downloaded as part of the install process, and more prerequisites to be installed.
    - Has a slight performance hit on Steam Deck, although still runs near 60FPS constant.
