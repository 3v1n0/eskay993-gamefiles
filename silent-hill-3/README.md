### SilentHill3.XInputFix.zip

A fix is required for the game to recognize XInput Right Stick, LT/RT, LS/RS and D-pad when assigning controls. XInputPLus has already been set up, so just unzip the file to the game install folder.

Also included in the zip is an updated `key.ini` which maps the controls to match PS2 contreol sheme. 

Everything should just work out of the box for any standard XInput compatible controller. No need to configure Steam Input.
