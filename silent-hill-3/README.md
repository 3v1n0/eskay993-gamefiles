### SilentHill3.XInputFix.zip

A fix is required for the game to recognize XInput Right Stick, LT/RT, LS/RS and D-pad when assigning controls. XInputPlus has already been set up, so just unzip the file to the game install folder.

Also included in the zip is an updated `key.ini` which maps the controls to match PS2 control sheme. 

Everything should just work out of the box for any standard XInput compatible controller. No need to configure Steam Input.

Should also be compatible with [Silent Hill 3 Audio Enhancement Pack](https://www.moddb.com/mods/silent-hill-3-audio-enhancement-pack), however you will need to rename `dinput8.dll` included with the audio pack to `dsound.dll`. Don't rename `dinput8.dll` from this zip to `d3d8.dll` like some guides and forum posts suggest.
